I am currently working as a graduate researcher in Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering at Purdue University. My main research focus is on designing suitable experiment design for agricultural field trials. I design field trials customized to the topography of the field to reduce random errors. This is made possible using public geographical datasets, high computational power, and machine learning based algorithms.  

## Recognitions

1. Bilsland Dissertation Fellowship
2. Graduate Student Best Poster Award at the 100th Conference of Research Workers in Animal Diseases, 2019
