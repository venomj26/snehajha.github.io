My name is Sneha Jha, a graduate researcher in Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering at Purdue University. My main research areas are Precision agriculture, field experiment design and decision support appplications. 

For my dissertation, I have focused on designing suitable experiments for agricultural field trials. I customize field trials to the topography of fields to reduce random errors. Publicly available geographical datasets are applied in machine learning based algorithms powered by high computational power to create field models. These cyber-physical models are employed to evaluate field processes and predict yield.  

I have worked on a few other interesting topics such as pavement management, antimicrobial resistance surveillance, and sentiment analysis towards precision ag using Twitter/X data. 

Beyond my research, I like to play tennis and read modern history.
