excerpt: 'Pivot+ is intended to serve as an innovative, multi-user research platform dedicated to scale, covering extensive areas. It effectively addresses many constraints that have historically
limited large-scale agricultural sensor and robotic research. This achievement would be possible
by augmenting well-established center pivot technology, known for its autonomy, with robust
power infrastructure, high-speed fiber, and wireless networking capabilities. The system would
also include environmentally controlled and protected cabinets to house non-field-hardened
sensors, data servers, and research sensors and systems, enabling remote data access.
Pivot+ would enable collaborative, field-scale research for agricultural sensors, communications,
robotics, and machine learning applications, including micro-meteorology, phenotyping, soil and
water interactions, and cropping systems management. A potential installation would cover a 115-
acre area, facilitating numerous parallel experiments. Data collection would occur at regular 90-
minute intervals, with the pivot operating in diverse weather and lighting conditions. Researchers
can leverage high-resolution soil order, drainage class, elevation, slope, and topographic position
classifiers to tailor site-specific experiments. The outcome would be a wealth of high-resolution
temporal and spatial observations, yielding the high-quality datasets demanded by modern AI and
machine learning methodologies. This paper covers a conceptual design of Pivot+ and discusses
its potential impacts on several important research areas.'
