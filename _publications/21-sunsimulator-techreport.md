title: "Development of an Intelligent Snowplow Truck that Integrates Telematics Technology, Roadway Sensors, and Connected Vehicle"
collection: Tech Reports
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) manages and maintains over 28,000 miles of roadways. Maintenance of the roadways includes pavement repair in the summer as well as snow removal and de-icing in the winter. The prioritization of assets during winter storm events is crucial and impacts travel and safety. The objective of this project was to identify and develop tools INDOT could provide its operators to effectively perform winter operation de-icing activities. This project examined application methods and data to provide analytics and make data-driven decisions for state-wide deployment and operations. Discovery of calibration metrics partnered with fleetwide telematics enabled the development of analytic dashboards that allowed real-time evaluations and adjustments to be made during winter operation activities. These tools will allow the agency to better treat and enhance safety for road users'
