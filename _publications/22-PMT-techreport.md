condition assessment and visualization"

excerpt: 'In this project, we looked at pavement structural condition parameters, falling weight deflectometer deflections with surface condition parameters, international roughness index, and cracking density for a better representation of overall pavement distress. A pavement-specific, threshold-based patching suggestion algorithm was designed to suggest pavement maintenance operations. The PCI thresholds for the developed algorithm were the intersecting values between the empirical cumulative distribution function for surface deflection and the structural number ratio threshold values for each pavement type. A web-based patching manager tool (PMT) was designed as an interactive tool to visualize and analyze pavement distress and patching suggestions on maps. The PMT was validated with road surface and right-of-way images obtained from three-dimensional laser sensors, and it could successfully capture localized distresses in existing pavements. Finally, an implementation phase was conducted with two major outputs: tooling was created to permanently store project data in an INDOT-managed Oracle database and the functionality of PMT was re-developed within an INDOT ArcGIS Online environment.'

The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) manages and maintains over 28,000 miles of roadways. Maintenance of the roadways includes pavement repair in the summer as well as snow removal and de-icing in the winter. The prioritization of assets during winter storm events is crucial and impacts travel and safety. The objective of this project was to identify and develop tools INDOT could provide its operators to effectively perform winter operation de-icing activities. This project examined application methods and data to provide analytics and make data-driven decisions for state-wide deployment and operations. Discovery of calibration metrics partnered with fleetwide telematics enabled the development of analytic dashboards that allowed real-time evaluations and adjustments to be made during winter operation activities. These tools will allow the agency to better treat and enhance safety for road users.
