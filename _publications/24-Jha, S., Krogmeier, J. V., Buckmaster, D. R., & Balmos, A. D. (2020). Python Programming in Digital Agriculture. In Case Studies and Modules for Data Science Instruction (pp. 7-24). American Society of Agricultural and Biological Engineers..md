excerpt: 'The primary objective of this instructional module is to concisely share good practices of instruction and provide example problems for instructors and students that enable efficient learning of Python with a focus on agricultural applications. In doing so, this teaching module formulates learning goals in Python programming, identifies good resources for Python programming, and provides exercises to evaluate learning. The module developed takes nominally 8-10 hours of instructional (class) time and specifically targets novices in the Python language.'

The primary objective of this instructional module is to concisely share good practices of instruction and provide example problems for instructors and students that enable efficient learning of Python with a focus on agricultural applications. In doing so, this teaching module formulates learning goals in Python programming, identifies good resources for Python programming, and provides exercises to evaluate learning. The module developed takes nominally 8-10 hours of instructional (class) time and specifically targets novices in the Python language.
