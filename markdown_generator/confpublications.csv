2024-16-07,Design of an autonomous ag platform capable of field-scale data collection in support of artificial intelligence.,"Proceedings of the 16th Proceedings of the 16th
International Conference on Precision Agriculture (ICPA) ","Pivot+ is intended to serve as an innovative, multi-user research platform dedicated to scale, covering extensive areas. It effectively addresses many constraints that have historically
limited large-scale agricultural sensor and robotic research. This achievement would be possible
by augmenting well-established center pivot technology, known for its autonomy, with robust
power infrastructure, high-speed fiber, and wireless networking capabilities. The system would
also include environmentally controlled and protected cabinets to house non-field-hardened
sensors, data servers, and research sensors and systems, enabling remote data access.
Pivot+ would enable collaborative, field-scale research for agricultural sensors, communications,
robotics, and machine learning applications, including micro-meteorology, phenotyping, soil and
water interactions, and cropping systems management. A potential installation would cover a 115-
acre area, facilitating numerous parallel experiments. Data collection would occur at regular 90-
minute intervals, with the pivot operating in diverse weather and lighting conditions. Researchers
can leverage high-resolution soil order, drainage class, elevation, slope, and topographic position
classifiers to tailor site-specific experiments. The outcome would be a wealth of high-resolution
temporal and spatial observations, yielding the high-quality datasets demanded by modern AI and
machine learning methodologies. This paper covers a conceptual design of Pivot+ and discusses
its potential impacts on several important research areas.","Balmos A. D., Jha S., Krogmeier J. V., Buckmaster D. R., Love D. J., Grant R. H., Crawford M.,","Balmos A. D., Jha S., Krogmeier J.

2024-16-07,OATSmobile: a Data Hub for Underground Sensor Communications and Rural IoT,"Proceedings of the 16th Proceedings of the 16th
International Conference on Precision Agriculture (ICPA) ","Wireless Underground Sensor Networks (WUSNs) play a crucial role in precision agriculture by providing information about moisture levels, temperature, nutrient availability, and other relevant factors. However, the use of radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices for WUSNs has been relatively unexplored despite their benefits such as low power consumption. In this work, we develop a hardware platform, called OATSMobile, that enables radio-frequency identification (RFID) communications in WUSNs. OATSMobile is a mobile platform that carries a sensor reader for scanning underground RFID tags and is equipped with communication modules to transport collected data. In addition to collecting RFID data, our edge computer collects machine location and speed from a Real Time Kinematics (RTK) GPS device, soil moisture from externally installed LoRaWAN sensors, and ground-to-antenna height from a Wi-Fi enabled LiDAR sensor. Data is automatically transferred over the cell network to an Avena–based data pipeline for analysis and processing. With OATSMobile, we investigated the feasibility of RFID communications in the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) band for WUSNs. We evaluated the impact of soil moisture and temperature on RFID scanning performance by randomly placing RFID tags in soil blocks of different drainage classes at 2.5 cm depths and measuring the Received Signal Strength Index (RSSI) and scanning success rates at different stages of the corn growing season. The nominal antenna height was 32 cm above ground, and the machine traveled at 0.44 m/s. As a result, we confirmed that 152 out of 282 tags were detected, for an overall success rate of 54.86%. Other results, such as the impact of soil moisture, antenna height, and machine speed impact will be discussed in this paper. Finally, we outline pathways for developing communications frameworks for WUSNs applied to precision agriculture.","Brinton C., Wang C., & Cappelleri D. (2024).

7/1/18,Analyzing Trends for Agricultural Decision Support System Using Twitter Data,"Proceedings of the 14th Proceedings of the 16th
International Conference on Precision Agriculture (ICPA) ","The trends and reactions of the general public towards global events can be analyzed using data from social platforms, including Twitter. The number of tweets has been reported to help detect variations in communication traffic within subsets like countries, age groups and industries. Similarly, publicly accessible data and (in particular) data from social media about agricultural issues provide a great opportunity for obtaining instantaneous snapshots of farmers’ opinions and a method to track changes in opinion through temporal analysis. In this paper we hypothesize that the presence of keywords like precision agriculture, digital agriculture, Internet of Things (IoT), BigData, remote sensing, GPS, etc., in tweets could serve as an indicator of discussions centered around interest in modern farming practices. We extracted relevant tweets using keywords such as IoT, BigData and Geographical Information System(GIS), and then analyzed their geographical origin and frequency of their mention. We analyzed the Twitter data for the period of 1st-11thJanuary, 2018 to understand these trends and the factors affecting them. These factors, such as special events, projects, biogeography, etc., were further analyzed using tweet sources and trending hashtags from the database. The regions with the highest interest in the keywords were United States, Egypt, Brazil, Japan and China. A comparison of frequency of keywords revealed IoT as the most tweeted word (77.6%) in the downloaded data. The most used language was English followed by Spanish, Japanese and French. Periodical tweets on #IoT from an account handled by IoT project on Twitter and Seminars on IoT in January in Santa Catarina(Brazil) were found to be the underlying factors for the observed trends.","ha S., Saraswat D., and Ward M.D. “Trends in Big Data solutions in Agricultural decision support","ha S., Saraswat D., and Ward M.D. “Trends in Big Data solutions in Agricultural decision support",http://Snehajha.github.io/files/Analyzing_Trends_for_Agricultural_Decision_Support_System_Using_Twitter_Data.pdf,
